# torspider

Fast asynchronous web-crawler based on [Tornado framework](http://tornadoweb.org).

Tested on:

* MacOSX
* Debian-based Linux.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

* Unix
* Python >= 3.5
* Redis server

### Installation

#### Required packages

To install required Python packages, run from the project root:

```
$ python setup.py install develop
```

Linux installation may require additional steps for building
[pycurl](http://pycurl.io) with SSL support. If so, you may find more convenient
to install the dependencies before running **setup.py** :

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If it fails at some stage because of a missing system package, install the
system package manually with your standard package manager (apt, yum, etc.),
then repeat the above command.

#### Testing

To run all the unit tests:

```
$ python -m unittest discover tests/ -p test_*.py
```

#### Configuration

Default configuration file is named **default.conf**. To override any of its
predefined settings, put desired key/value pair to **local.conf** or
provide an alternative via command-line option. The rule is simple:

* Options from **local.conf** override those from  **default.conf**.
* Options from command line override those from both the configuration files.

To see all available command-line options, run:

See also [the detailed options description](https://github.com/skrushinsky/torspider/wiki/Options).


```
$ torspider --help
```

##### Seeds

To provide initial URLs, edit **seeds.conf** file. If you do not provide any
**seeds**, the program will be able only to continue previous session. If there
were no previous sessions, or you start torspider with **--clear-tasks** option,
there won't be any tasks for workers.

### Running

```
$ torspider
```

With extra logging:

```
$ torspider --logging=debug
```

With 50 asynchronous workers:

```
$ torspider --workers=50
```

To stop after passing 5000 pages:

```
$ torspider --max-pages=5000
```

To clear all data from previous session:

```
$ torspider --clear-tasks
```

### Concurrency

Default number of workers is **10**, so that even my outdated laptop
with 1.7Gib memory and AMD C-50 processor running Linux with moderate WiFi
connection traverses 100 pages in about 3-5 minutes. Running 50-100 workers on
a contemporary MacBook gives much better results, but after several hours its
WiFi adapter breaks down. So, consider your hardware and network capacity.
This requires trial and error.

Also, tasks may be executed by a number of processes running in parallel. Example
of starting 10 separate processes:

```
$ seq 10 | xargs -Iz -P10 torspider
```
Of course, this is an extreme case!


## Extending

The program is *pluggable*. Briefly speaking, its primary responsibility is to
traverse the network following a set of rules. **How to use the results** is
entirely up to plugins. In one user scenario each page must be parsed and saved
to a database. Some other scenario requires extracting some special information
from the page, such as stock prices.

## TODOs:

1. More configurable settings.
1. Wiki.
1. Throttling: length of the tasks queue should not grow too quickly.
1. Black list of domains / addresses.
1. Pauses between succedent request to the same domain.
1. Additional content types.
1. Monitoring tools.
1. Sphinx-compatiable documentation.
